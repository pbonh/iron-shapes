# libreda-shapes - Euclidean geometry for LibrEDA
This is library is a collection of geometric primitives together with some fundamental algorithms.

## Acknowledgements
* This library was initially inspired by [geo/geo-types](https://github.com/georust/geo).
* For ease of use the naming of types and methods follows partially the API of [KLayout](https://klayout.de).

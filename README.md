# libreda-shapes - Euclidean geometry for LibrEDA
This is library is a collection of geometric primitives together with some fundamental algorithms.

## Acknowledgements
* Starting from December 2020 development of this crate is funded by [NLnet](https://nlnet.nl) and [NGI0](https://nlnet.nl/NGI0)
* This library was initially inspired by [geo/geo-types](https://github.com/georust/geo) and [servo/euclid](https://github.com/servo/euclid).
* For ease of use the naming of types and methods follows partially the API of [KLayout](https://klayout.de).
